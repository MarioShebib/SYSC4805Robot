Hello and welcome to our amazing project on the snowplow robot.

When using our robot in a testing map, no other applications are needed
as our project uses Lua coding to program our robot.

Once the testing map is opened and our robot is loaded into it,
go into the left_sensor, center_sensor, and right_sensor settings.
Under the "Entity to detect" drop down menu, select the shape
of the outer perimeter otherwise the robot will not work.

If the robot is not on the starting platform, the robot is programmed
to place itself on the starting platform once the simulation has started. 

When ready, you can start the simulation and watch as our robot
plows away all the snow from the desired area.

Thank you for your time,
Team Amethyst
